A quick tip to show on screen which media query you're developing against.

<h2>Quick Tip</h2>
<p>When developing and testing sites built for desktop and mobile I use Adobe's Edge Inspect to view my local dev environment on multiple devices.</p>

<p>On a project that we're developing with work at the moment we're using media queries to modify layout and style based on the screen width and the pixel ratio the devices have â€“ and the more media queries we use the more confusing it's becoming to quickly add/remove styles in the appropriate media queries as we go!</p>

<p>So as a quick little tip to help me see which query a device is using I added an element on the page and in each media query, added a string via the content attribute.</p>

<h2>The Codez</h2>
<p>Firstly add an empty div for this in your HTML:</p>
<pre class="html"><code>
  &lt;div class="query"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<small>You could also just add it as an <code class="inline">:after</code> element on the body or something if you wanted.</small>

<p>Now the CSS:</p>
<div data-gist="7696931"></div>

Wherein [ ]  you should write <code class="inline">@media only screen and (min-device-width:768px) and (max-device-width:1024px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:2)</code> and so on&hellip;

<ul>
  <li>Add an element at the top of your page</li>
  <li>Use CSS content to add a string describing your media queries into element:after so you can see what you're working with!</li>
</ul>
