<h2>Waiting for the build to kick in&hellip;</h2>
The other day whilst waiting for the CI server to build I thought I could quickly make a random iOS7 app icon generator to jump on the bandwagon of poking a little bit of fun at some of the newly redesigned iOS7 icons&hellip;

<h2>Here it is</h2>
It took a little longer than 5 minutes obviously but I finished it tonight and you can find it at <a href="http://daniel.furzeface.com/ios-seven-me">iOS7 Icon Generator.</a>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>To be honest, I like the majority of the iOS redesign, I'm not going to go into it as pretty much everyone has written about everything I ever wanted to say about it, but there's a great article by <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2013/06/12/ios-7" rel="external">Matt Gemmell</a> that I agree with most of, if you wanted to know.</p>
