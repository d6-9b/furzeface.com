I wrote my first <a href="http://gulpjs.com" rel="external">Gulp</a> plugin, a light wrapper for our node-combine-mq task.

<h2>Innovation Day</h2>
<p>Once a month at <a href="http://building-blocks.com" rel="external">Building Blocks</a> we have an Innovation Day. On these days we have the opportunity to work on fun internal projects, open source projects or generally just read up on the latest tech and improve our skillset and knowledge.</p>
<p>The last two innovation days me and the <a href="http://paulwelsh.info" rel="external">Spacedawwwg</a> have been working on rewriting BB's Grunt plugin to combine media queries, porting the features to a Node package and wrapping them in a light Grunt task (as it should be!).</p>
<p>I ended up taking our innovation day project a step further and created a simple Gulp wrapper for the task.</p>

<h2>Gulp Combine MQ</h2>
<p>Now bare in mind that Iâ€™d only first played with Gulp the day before I wrote this plugin but it works quite nicely - even though it currently needs a <a href="https://github.com/frontendfriends/gulp-combine-mq/issues" rel="external">little affection</a>.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Simply install and save{{#note 1}}{{/note}} as you would any Node package:</p>
<code>
  $ npm install --save-dev gulp-combine-mq
</code>
<small>{{#note_ref 1}}{{/note_ref}}Remember in the last step to pass the <code class="inline">--save-dev</code> flag to save it in your <code class="inline">package.json</code> and your project.</small>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>And add the following to your <code class="inline">gulpfile.js</code>:</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    var combineMq = require('gulp-combine-mq');

    gulp.src('./src/**/*.css')
      .pipe(combineMq())
      .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist'));
  </code>
</pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/frontendfriends/gulp-combine-mq" rel="external">Gulp-combine-mq</a> is a light Gulp wrapper for our Node combine media queries task. It is useful for CSS generated by preprocessors using nested media queries.</p>
<p>Currently it has been downloaded over 100 times and I personally use it in a couple of projects.</p>
